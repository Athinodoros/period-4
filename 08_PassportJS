------------passportJS------------



Passport JS is a library that take care a lot of boiler plate code and makes it easy
to connect and get authenticated from many big platforms like facebook, google etc. and by doing so
the server that handles the authentication of the user returns a token for the user to use and
continue browsing.


Unfortunately my demo for this exercise is the simple facebook log-in we did in class.
look at facebook-login-simple-example in this repository :)
