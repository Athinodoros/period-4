----------------SSL-----------------


initially the client sties to connect to an ssl environment if it fails it is redirected to the standard http version
of the website, but is succeeds and a handshake between the client and the server is made then a back an forth communication
takes place where the server and the client exchange information on what encryption algorithms they support and once they
find a common ground they can both work with and then the SSL connection is established.
Again :

1: Handshake and encryption method/algorithm agreement
2: Server Sends certificate
3: Client says : Start encrypting
4: Server says : Start encrypting
5: all messages are now encrypted


After that point they encrypt the data they both send with the same algorithm and decrypt accordingly.
