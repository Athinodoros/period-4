process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their
server resources without sharing their credentials. In other words
OAuth authorization is a framework that enables a third-party application
to obtain limited access to an HTTP service to verify a user.

OpenID allows you to use an existing account to sign in to multiple websites,
without needing to create new passwords.
